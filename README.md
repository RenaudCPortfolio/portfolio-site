Renaud's portfolio

deployment version: https://project-portfolio-fawn.vercel.app/

Without taking the too long time to make everything in this portfolio its own game, i wanted to showcase the animation of things i've created. 
This is why i've made a lot of different mouse over effects, including the loading of gifs.

The popup tooltip is inspired by Tippy, except Tippy did some things i didn't like. So i made my own. It was a lot tougher than it looked, because everyone on the internet was trying to get me to make a ref/useRef and my solution was way simpler.

I really wanted a funny arrow that points to my face. it is done.
Pretty impressed w the drop shadow style filters of css, it really has come a long way and can make simple monochrome logos look pretty great.
